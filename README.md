### Warning
The GraphQL Java tutorial by [@kaqqao](https://github.com/kaqqao) is unfortunately outdated and also uses some third party libraries on top of GraphQL Java, without making it clear that it is actually not GraphQL Java itself. The author is working on an updated version. Meanwhile, our recommend approach can be found [here](https://www.graphql-java.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-spring-boot/).

More information about this issue can be found [here](https://github.com/howtographql/howtographql/issues/913).
